Exercise 5.1 (Find an online learning problem from real life). Find two examples of real life problems
that fit into the online learning framework (online, not reinforcement!). For each of the two examples
explain what is the set of actions an algorithm can take, what are the losses (or rewards) and what is the
range of the losses/rewards, whether the problem is stateless or contextual, and whether the problem is
i.i.d. or adversarial, and with full information or bandit feedback

Post Recommendation on Social Media

Deciding in real time which article or advertisement to display to a user.

Actions:
The algorithm chooses one item (news article or ad) from a finite set of options.

Reward:
1 if the user clicks on the suggested content, 0 if the user does not (range [0, 1]).
In more sophisticated systems, the reward could be based on the time spent by the user on the suggested content.

Stateless vs. Contextual:
In the simplest implementation, it could be stateless, basing recommendations exclusively on the outcomes of previous interactions.
However, in actual implementations, it is contextual, as the algorithm considers the user's profile and related information.

Environment (i.i.d. vs. Adversarial):
While an idealized model might assume users arrive from an i.i.d. process, real-world user behavior is often adversarial (or non-stationary) as preferences and trends shift over time.

Feedback:
The feedback is bandit feedback; the algorithm only observes the outcome (click or no click) for the displayed item, not for all items in the set.

Pricing of Products Over Time

Set of Actions:
Each day, the algorithm can change the price of a product, selecting from a fixed number of price options.

Reward:
The reward is defined as the profit obtained at the end of the day, which is the revenue from sales minus the cost of production.
The range of the reward is (0, +âˆž) since we assume that none of the prices are lower than the production cost.

Stateless vs. Contextual:
The problem could be considered stateless if the algorithm only considers the prices and profits of the previous days.

Environment (i.i.d. vs. Adversarial):
The environment could be considered i.i.d. if the demand for the product remains constant over time.
However, in reality, it is adversarial, as demand can change over time, especially for products that are not purchased repeatedly.

Feedback Type:
The feedback in dynamic pricing is of the bandit type, as the algorithm only observes the reward for the chosen action (applied price).
