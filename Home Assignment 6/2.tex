\subsection{Part 1}

Evaluating algorithms for online learning with limited feedback in real-life scenarios is challenging. 
While the most direct approach is to implement an algorithm and measure its performance live, this is often not feasible due to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Potential risks, costs, and time delays.} Deploying a potentially suboptimal algorithm can lead to high financial or reputational costs. Moreover, once the algorithm is running, it takes time to collect sufficient data for analysis, which delays insights and can be inefficient if the algorithm underperforms.

    \item \textbf{Difficulty of controlled experimentation.} Once data is collected based on a particular algorithm's actions, it is nearly impossible to ``replay'' the same conditions to test different algorithms under identical circumstances. This lack of controlled repetition makes fair comparisons difficult.
\end{itemize}
